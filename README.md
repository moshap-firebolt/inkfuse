# Incremental Fusion

This repository contains InkFuse - a prototype database for an Incremental Fusion database combining code generation and vectorization.

As a research prototype, InkFuse is exclusively focused on showing how to build an Incremental Fusion engine. It does not contain components deemed essential for modern production databases like a SQL parser, optimizer or concurrency control mechanisms.

Rather, the interface to InkFuse are hand-crafted physical operator trees.
