# Benchmarking Inkfuse

This directory contains the required scripts to benchmark InkFuse on TPC-H, as well as run it against other systems.

As InkFuse does not support all SQL constructs for the raw TPC-H queries, the directory contains a simplified schema and slightly simplified queries that match the physical plans run by InkFuse.
