    /// An operator can be a DAG of these fragments which can either be interpreted through the vectorized
    /// primitives or fused together.
    ///
    /// A suboperator is parametrized in two different ways:
    /// - Discrete DoF: the suboperator is parametrized over a finite set of potential values. Examples might be
    ///                 SQL types like UInt8, Date, Timestamp, ...
    /// - Infinite DoF: the suboperator is parametrized over an infinite set of potential values. Examples might be
    ///                 the length of a varchar type, or the offset into an aggregation state.
    ///
    /// When defining a suboperator, we define both the discrete and infinite degrees of freedom.
    ///
    /// When we exectute the query down the line, note that these parameters above are actually *not* degrees of freedom.
    /// This is an important observation, at run time these are all substituted.
    /// Two conclusions can be drawn from this:
    ///      1) In a pipeline-fusing engine, all parameters would be substitued with hard-baked values
    ///      2) In a vectorized engine, there would be fragments over the discrete space spanned by
    ///         the parameters, but the infinite degrees of freedom would be provided through function parameters.
    ///
    /// This concept is baked through the SubstitutableParameter expression type within our IR. When generating code,
    /// the actual operator is able to use both discrete and infinite degrees of freedom in a hard-coded way.
    /// The substitution into either function parameters or baked-in values then happens in the lower parts of the
    /// compilation stack depending on which parameters are provided to the compiler backend.
    ///
    /// This allows switching between vectorized fragments and JIT-fused execution through the same operators,
    /// parameter logic and codegen structure.
